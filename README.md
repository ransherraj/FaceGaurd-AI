# 🛡️ FaceGuard AI - Real-Time Face Mask Detection System

**FaceGuard AI** is a real-time, AI-powered web application that detects whether a person is wearing a face mask, wearing it partially, or not wearing it at all using webcam or image input. It leverages modern frontend and backend technologies for seamless camera streaming, fast inference, and intuitive user feedback — all built for deployment at scale.
